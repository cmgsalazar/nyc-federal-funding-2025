BILINGUALISM IN THE STEM WORKFORCE IS ESSENTIAL, GIVEN THE GROWING DIVERSE POPULATION IN THE U.S. AND THE INDUSTRY DEMANDS FOR BILINGUAL PROFESSIONALS IN STEM FIELDS THAT ARE CRUCIAL FOR GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS AND INNOVATION. THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPANISH HERITAGE LEARNERS (WHO GREW UP BILINGUALLY IN THE US) AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS (WHO STARTED ACQUIRING ENGLISH AFTER PUBERTY) AS WELL AS THE DIVERSE INSTITUTIONAL CULTURES; THE CREATION AND VALIDATION OF A MIXED METHODS MODEL TO EVALUATE INSTITUTIONAL READINESS; AND SHARING OUR FRAMEWORK AND RESULTS WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS, THUS ENHANCING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO RESEARCH UNDERGRADUATE BILINGUAL STUDENTS IN STEM FIELDS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE PROJECT ARE: 1) TO RESEARCH IDENTITY AND BELONGING AMONG SPANISH-ENGLISH BILINGUAL STEM STUDENTS AT TWO HSIS; 2) TO ASSESS THE LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY OF THESE STUDENTS; AND 3) TO EVALUATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES FOR CREATING A BILINGUAL STEM TRANSFER PIPELINE. UTILIZING A MIXED METHODS APPROACH, THE PROJECT WILL COMBINE DATA FROM SURVEYS, LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TESTS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS, INSTRUCTORS, AND COLLEGE ADMINISTRATORS. THIS PLANNING PROJECT WILL GENERATE VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE LANGUAGE READINESS AND INTEREST OF STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS FOR ENGAGING IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HCC, WHERE SPANISH IS THE DOMINANT LANGUAGE, AND JJC, WHERE ENGLISH IS THE DOMINANT LANGUAGE, WILL GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE ON INTERSECTIONAL POPULATIONS AND THEIR LATINX IDENTITIES AND SENSES OF BELONGING AND EMPOWERMENT. THE FINDINGS WILL BE DISSEMINATED LOCALLY WITHIN CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AND MORE BROADLY THROUGH NATIONAL CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS GEARED TOWARD DIVERSITY IN UNDERGRADUATE STEM EDUCATION AND IN SOCIOLOGY, CRIMINOLOGY, AND LINGUISTICS. THE HSI PROGRAM AIMS TO ENHANCE UNDERGRADUATE STEM EDUCATION AND BUILD CAPACITY AT HSIS. PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY THE HSI PROGRAM WILL ALSO GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS.

HOSTOS IS A HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTION THAT SERVES THE RESIDENTS OF NEW YORK CITY?S SOUTH BRONX. OVER ITS SIX-YEAR DURATION, THIS PROJECT WILL FUND SCHOLARSHIPS TO 30 UNIQUE FULL AND/OR PART TIME STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING ASSOCIATE AND BACHELOR?S DEGREES IN MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL, CIVIL, CHEMICAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING. THE STUDENTS WILL START AT HCC AND TRANSITION SEAMLESSLY TO THE BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM AT THE CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK?S GROVE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING. FIRST- AND SECOND-YEAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE A FULL YEAR OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR UP TO FOUR YEARS OF STUDY, INCLUDING UP TO TWO YEARS AT HCC AND TRANSFER STUDENTS UP TO TWO YEARS AT CITY COLL?GE OF NEW YORK. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INCREASE THE RATES OF RETENTION AND GRADUATION FOR STUDENTS PURSUING DEGREES IN ENGINEERING BY COMBINING FINANCIAL SUPPORT, A ROBUST FACULTY AND PEER MENTORING PROGRAM, AND ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH STUDENT SUCCESS. SUCH SERVICES INCLUDE WRITING ACROSS DISCIPLINES IN THE STEM CURRICULUM; MENTORED IMMERSIVE UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES; SUPPORT FOR TRANSFER TO A FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTION; EXPOSURE TO STEM-RELATED WORKING AND PROFESSIONAL FACILITIES; PARTICIPATION AT PROFESSIONAL STEM CONFERENCES; CAREER ORIENTATION WORKSHOPS; AND AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

THIRD, IS TO ADOPT EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES AND ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL STUDENT LEARNING, SENSE OF BELONGING, AND HIGH SELF-EFFICACY. FOURTH, IS TO GENERATE KNOWLEDGE THROUGH AN INTEGRATED RESEARCH/EVALUATION EFFORT THAT INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF A NOVEL COMBINED FACULTY AND PEER MENTORING APPROACH, WHILE ALSO EXAMINING THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT TRANSFER FROM TWO- TO FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTIONS.
